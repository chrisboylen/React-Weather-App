Weatherly was created by Todd Ayres and Chris Boylen for Turing School of Software and Design. 

It is essentially a weather app that uses search functionality to render parsed data from API object and arrays for a 10 day, 7 day and current weather experience.

UX was inspired by a simplistic matte design that subverts the more "sleek modern" designs for a comfortable yet navigatable experience.

Below is a version of our mockup process, inspiration and ultimate design.
